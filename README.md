This Section is for information to Developers, who further choose to utilize the MIT License and refine/edit the code
1. The program based on Python Essentially Works as a Data base to classify every question in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) Physics past papers belonging to a certain topic.<br/>
2. The Topic for every individual question is entered in integer form with the list given in the IB Guide, and as of now only whole number topics are supported. Sub-topics are not supported. However, Multiple topics can be entered by seperating the two with a double space..<br/>
3. After Entry, the software will store iinformation entered by the user in .txt format, in directory -  .../PROGRAMS/1/ OR .../PROGRAMS/2/ Depending on the level of the paper. <br/>
4. Later, while accessing the database of papers, this software uses PyPDF2 to readt through PDFs, merge PDF files and create a seperate file filled with questions of the desired topic.<br/>
