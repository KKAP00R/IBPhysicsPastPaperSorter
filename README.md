Code for sorting Physics IB Past Papers Questions Topic-wise
BEFORE ACCESSING THIS FILE AND USING IT, PLEASE READ THIS TEXT FILE CAREFULLY.

FEW IMPORTANT POINTS TO NOTE HOW THIS WORKS:
THE SOFTWARE BASED ON PYTHON ESSENTIALLY WORKS AS A DATA BASE TO AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFY EVERY QUESTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL BACCALUREATE (IB) PHYSICS PAST PAPER BELONGING TO A CERTAIN TOPIC.
THE TOPIC IS TO BE ENTERED IN THE INTEGER FORM AND AS OF NOW, ONLY WHOLE NUMBER TOPICS ARE SUPPORTED, SUB TOPICS ARE NOT SUPPORTED, BUT MULTIPLE TOPICS CAN BE USED IF SEPERATED VIA A DOUBLE SPACE IN THE ENTRY TAB.
AFTER ENTRY, THE SOFTWARE WILL STORE INFORMATION ENTERED BY THE USER IN FILES OF DIRECTORY - .../PROGRAMS/1/ OR .../PROGRAMS/2/ DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF THE PAPER.
LATER, WHEN ACCESSING, THIS SOFTWARE USES THE PyPDF2 TO READ THROUGH PDFs.
ULTIMATELY, A FILE IS CREATED IN THE IB FOLDER WHERE THE TOPIC SORTED FILES ARE PRESENT.

THINGS TO DO BEFORE USING THE PROGRAM:
IN LINES 551, 613, 684, 754, 818, 876, AND 1064 ENTER TEH PATH TO THE PROGRAMS FOLDER.

THANKS FOR USING THIS SOFTWARE.
HOPE YOU ENJOY IT.
